- [x] Write a Python function that takes a string and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string contains all the letters in the alphabet

- [ ] Two words are an anagram if they have the same letters (possibly in different order). Write a python function that takes a list of words and return a list of sets of anagrams. For example:

```
anagrams(['add', 'dad', 'help', 'more', 'rome']) == 
[{'add', 'dad'}, {'help'}, {'more', 'rome'}]
```


Break until 14:45


Files and OS
- [x] import os
- [x] import pathlib
- [x] reading and writing text files
- [x] running external programs
- [x] sys and sys.argv

Working with files lab

15:50-16:30

- [ ] Create a text file that contains a multiplication table, ie:

```
1  2  3  4   5  6  7  8  9 10
2  4  6  8  10 12 14 16 18 20
3  6  9  12 15 18 21 24 27 30
...
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
```

- [ ] Create a program that creates copies of itself: It takes from sys.argv a list of names of copies, and copies itself to each name

- [ ] Create a program that takes a file name from sys.argv and prints the number of lines in that file

## Search in pathlib doc
- [ ] Print the names of all *.py files in a given directory
- [ ] Find all the *.py files in a directory that do `import pathlib`
- [ ] Find all the files in a given directory whose size is larger than 1MB



- [ ] Print out only the file names (not directories) in a given directory and all its sub-directories
- [ ] Write a python script that reads a file name from the user and prints the first 5 lines in that file
- [ ] Write a python script that reads a file name from the user and prints the last 5 lines in that file



Classes and Objects
- [ ] Object Oriented Concepts
- [ ] Defining and Using classes
- [ ] Methods and Instance Variables
