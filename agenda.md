### Python Syntax Lab
Time is now 14:37
Work time on the first batch of exercises until 15:07

- [ ] Write a python script that reads a user's age in years and prints out its age in months

- [ ] Create a Python program to check the complexity of a password
      If the password contains a digit -> add 1 to its complexity score
      If it contains an uppercase letter -> add 1 to its complexity score
      If it contains a non-letter sign (!@$) -> add 1 to its complexity score
      Print the password complexity score



### More Python Syntax
- [ ] Loops and Conditionals
- [ ] Strings, Numbers, Booleans



### Python Syntax Lab Part 2

- [ ] Write a python script that reads 3 numbers and print the largest one

- [ ] Write a python script that reads a user's age in years and prints out its age in months

- [ ] Write a python script that reads a number and prints out the sum of its digits
