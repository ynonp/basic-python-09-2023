- [ ] Write a Python function that takes an array of numbers, calculate the average number and returns only the numbers that are larger than the average

- [ ] Write a Python function that takes a string and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string contains all the letters in the alphabet

- [ ] Two words are an anagram if they have the same letters (possibly in different order). Write a python function that takes a list of words and return a list of sets of anagrams. For example:

```
anagrams(['add', 'dad', 'help', 'more', 'rome']) == 
[{'add', 'dad'}, {'help'}, {'more', 'rome'}]
```

### Working With files (if time permits)

- [ ] The pathlib module

- [ ] Listing files and directories

- [ ] Print out some lines from a file


### Working with files lab

- [ ] Print the names of all *.py files in a given directory

- [ ] Find all the *.py files in a directory that do `import pathlib`

- [ ] Find all the files in a given directory whose size is larger than 1MB

- [ ] Print out only the file names (not directories) in a given directory and all its sub-directories

- [ ] Write a python script that reads a file name from the user and prints the first 5 lines in that file

- [ ] Write a python script that reads a file name from the user and prints the last 5 lines in that file
